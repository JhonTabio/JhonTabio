<p id="bio">
  Graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.

  Software Developer at the University of Central Florida
  
  I like to build software that interests me, usually either meddling around <strong>software</strong> that pertains to games or poking fun at <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.  
  
  I have adopted various <strong>industry</strong> and <strong>social skills</strong> that allows me to easily integrate myself in any sort of team environment. 
  
  One of my greatest technical challenges I dove into was switching my development enviornment from <strong>Windows</strong> to <strong>Linux</strong>, learning more about the Linux Operating System with every passing day.
  
  One of my greatest achievements is having the chance to work alongside <strong>Microsoft</strong> and their <strong>TEALS division</strong> to bring more accessibility of computer science to High schools that did not have a strong CS program. I was able to gather the communication skills and patience to teach a group of high schoolers about the fundamentals of programming.
